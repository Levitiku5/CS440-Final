## Project Description
This repository contains the code for building a model to generate Python documentation, the code to gather metrics about that model, and an article written about our findings.

## Repository Structure
- `article/`: Contains the LaTeX source files for the article as well as the compiled PDF.
- `DocstringGen/`: Contains the code for the model.
- `ollama/`: Docstring generation examples using ollama.
- `final.py`: Reads a .py file and generates a README.md file containing a summary of the code's structure, including functions, classes, and meaningful comments.

## Notable Files
- `article/report.pdf`: The compiled article.
- `DocstringGen/DocStringGen.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for the model.
