the results of this project showed that it's possible to use machine learning to generate Python documentation, even with limited resources. While our model's scores were far from perfect and didnâ€™t match up to more advanced models like ChatGPT-4, it still managed to produce docstrings that were relevant and on-topic. This proves the concept works, with more training time and optimized parameters there's a lot of potential for improving the results. In the future, models like this could play a big role in making the process of creating software documentation faster and more efficient.
